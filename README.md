This project is a part of my learning process with Selenium WebDriver using the Java programming language, aimed at building automation testing skills. This mini project focuses on testing web applications and gaining hands-on experience with automation tools, utilizing a hybrid automation framework incorporating Selenium, Java, Maven, TestNG, and the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern. It also includes foundational knowledge in Selenium Grid, Docker, and Jenkins for distributed and continuous testing practices, preparing me for a career as a software tester.
